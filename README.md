# ♠️ CSS Playing Card (Ace of Spades)

A simple **HTML + CSS project** that recreates a **playing card** design — specifically the **Ace of Spades**. The card uses flexbox and transforms to position the suit symbols correctly, mimicking the look of a real deck card.

## ✨ Features
- **Card Layout**  
  - Top section shows the card value (`A`) and suit (`♠`).  
  - Center section displays a large spade symbol.  
  - Bottom section mirrors the top, rotated for authentic card orientation.  

- **Accurate Styling**  
  - Black spade symbols with clean typography.  
  - Rounded corners and border for realistic card appearance.  

- **Customizable Variables**  
  - `--card-height` controls card size.  
  - Width automatically scales to maintain proportions.  

- **Responsive Centering**  
  - Flexbox centers the card both vertically and horizontally on the page.  

- **Minimal Structure**  
  - Simple HTML with `.card`, `.top`, `.center`, and `.bottom` sections.  
  - Lightweight CSS for layout, font styling, and transforms.
